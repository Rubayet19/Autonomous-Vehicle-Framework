[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:39 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGeographicLib.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "GeographicLib", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GeographicLib"
  with any of the following names:

    GeographicLibConfig.cmake
    geographiclib-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GeographicLib" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GeographicLib_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "GeographicLib" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
